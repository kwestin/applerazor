These scripts are examples of how to gather information, execute commands and exfiltrated data using iTunes with AppleScript apps. 

To disguise the exported application as an MP3 file, you will want to add this to the end of your file name:
 Ì¨mp3
 
 This character is called an "oganek" and is a turkish character that looks like a period. If you add a .mp3 to the file OS X will 
 automatically add a .app to the end of it cueing the end user into the fact it is an app and not an MP3. 
 
 You will also want to replace the application icon wiht the MP3 icon to further disguise the file as an MP3.
